    <meta name="keywords" content="Guru session is the Guru Foundation’s conference designed to educate and connect leaders, entrepreneurs and change makers who are making a big positive impact in the world.
The theme for this year is TRANSFORMING COMMUNITIES. The conference provides a unique platform for knowledge sharing, connecting local, national, regional and global agendas; providing a global network for leaders, entrepreneurs, policy makers and change makers working to transform their communities." />
    <meta name="description" content="Guru Session started in the city of Calabar in 2018 because of our passion to see young people have and
live a "Calabar Dream". We were tired of having young people constantly relocating out of the city because
they believed nothing good can happen here.
Our way of solving this problem was to create a conference - Guru Session that celebrates success stories
of people that made it in Calabar and as well use them to inspire young people.
We started the Conference with zero capital and a strong zeal driven by our Founder - Oyo Effiom. In the
first year of the conference, we broke our target of having 300 participants rather we had 576 young
people in attendance. After the Conference, many young persons were fired up to start their
entrepreneurship journey. Our story went out loud in the city and many young people joined our
community. We became the home to ambitious young people in Calabar. The 2019 edition bolded our
work as we attracted over 2000 participants in attendance and two Presidential Candidates as Speakers.
The 2020 edition tested our strength and resolve due to the novel Corona Virus. Nigeria announced a
lockdown 2 days to the conference and by this time, our partners from Europe were already in Calabar.
Due to the pandemic, 60 percent of our resource persons declined to speak at the event. But with the
help of the Commissioner for Health Cross River State, we held a successful conference.
Guru Session is a conference designed to bridge the knowledge gap for young people that are desiring to
live their dreams. The Conference links exceptional local voices to young people that want to duplicate
their success stories.
We use Resource Persons with hindsight to fuel the insight and foresight of our participants. Guru Session
opens our participants to a year-long mentorship that provides a strong compass for their pursuit.
THEME: MOVE - Evolving in difficult times
The global pandemic left everyone startle of what next? Businesses were short down, cities locked,
schools closed, religious centers empty and for once humanity felt helpless.
What a time it is. People everywhere are angry, suspicious, and distrustful... often with good reason. And
yet, might it be possible to emerge from the current fiery moment stronger than before? Wiser? Happier?
With the careful combination of visionary ideas, strategic planning, hard work and lucky timing, we think
so. At this very special Guru Session, we'll celebrate the clear-eyed and the bold of heart, those who don't
shy away from the most intractable-seeming problems but rather step toward them to make the case
that, even now, hope is possible.
Guru Session 2021 is packaged to help our participants take the next BIG MOVE in embracing the new
normal. The conference will provide a clear compass on how anyone from any sector can "evolve in
difficult times".
